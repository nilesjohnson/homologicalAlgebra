\subsection{Motivation}

There are pathologies in the category of chain complexes.  For
example, $Hom_{\mathbb{Z}}(C, \mathbb{Z})$ could have nontrivial
homology even if $C$ has trivial homology!  Same problem, e.g., for $-
\otimes \mathbb{Z}/p$.

This means that a category of chain complexes modulo weak equivalence
wouldn't have well-defined hom objects or tensor products.

This kind of problem occurs for topological spaces too:  The Warsaw
circle, $W$, has trivial homotopy groups, but the mapping space from
$W$ to the circle has nontrivial homotopy!

\subsection{Solution for spaces}

In spaces, the CW complexes form a well-behaved subcategory, and every
space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex.  So one could ``restrict''
to CW complexes.  We still do want to consider all spaces, so develop
a system for coherently replacing any space with a CW complex . . .

The analogous solution in chain complexes comes in the form of
resolutions!  This can be done in two different (dual) ways . . .
